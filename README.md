The following are instructions for creating your slides. Please name both of the code and slide files as **30100_P1_YourFirstName**.

Ideally, each of the four aspects should be described in one slide. Please remember that: <br>
(a) try to summarize each aspect in a clear and logical way in your slides (sometimes organizing the content in a table helps); <br>
(b) in technical presentation, smooth logic is the most important thing; <br>
(c) try to make your presentation short and to the point, and avoid the wordy way. <br>

Here are the four aspects:
- **Task**:
	- summarize your task in less than 3 sentences
	- is it classification (binary or multi-class) or regression?
- **Data**:
	- What does your data looks like? (e.g., a screenshot of your dataframe)
	- What's the data size? How do you get training and testing set?
	- If it's classification, what is the class distribution (e.g., how many samples in each class) If it's regression, what is the regression value distribution (e.g., histogram of the values)?
	- What's your feature space? How many features? What type of features? (e.g., 10 features in total, 8 numerical, 2 categorical)
	- What data preprocessing steps you have done?
- **Model**:
	- Which model(s) did you use?
	- For each model, which parameter values did you tune (if you are not using the default value)?
	- What is the model performance? (e.g., show the classification report)
	- If you are applying multiple models, one slide for each model, and then a separate slide shows the comparison between different models.
- **Result analysis**:
	- Interpret the model performance (e.g., top coefficient features for each class, or what does the decision tree looks like)
	- Show examples where the classifier fails (e.g., the test samples that the classifier make wrong predictions)
	- Error analysis: explain where do you think the errors come from and why? Do you have any possible solution to improve the model performance?
