# Predict popularity of courses on the Udemy platform
In this project, several variables are used to make predictions for the number of subscribers of Udemy online courses. The analysis and prediction can help the stakeholders (Udemy platform, course providers/designers/instructors) to identify key factors that decide if a course would attract a large number of subscribers, and possibly make adjustment on future online courses.
\
The analysis has been performed in [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/fiofiofiona/Udemy-course-popularity-prediction/blob/main/analysis.ipynb) along with all results and figures. A presentation that describes the problem statement and analysis details can be found in the [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18mT9F1DJczgfPqylXRL_9BKkvxeIrFd6/view?usp=sharing) and the [slides](https://github.com/fiofiofiona/Udemy-course-popularity-prediction/blob/main/slides.pptx).
